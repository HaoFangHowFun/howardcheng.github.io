In this project, I intergrated the DentiBot, the first robot specifically designed for dental endodontic treatment. The DentiBot is equipped with a force and torque sensor, as well as a string-based Patient Tracking Module, allowing for real-time monitoring of endodontic file contact and patient movement. We propose a 6-DoF hybrid position/force controller that enables autonomous adjustment of the surgical path and compensation for patient movement, while also providing protection against endodontic file fracture. In addition, a file flexibility model is incorporated to compensate for file bending. Pre-clinical evaluations performed on acrylic root canal models and resin teeth confirm the feasibility of the DentiBot in assisting endodontic treatment. This work has been published to IROS 2022 and submitted to Transaction on Robotics (T-RO).
