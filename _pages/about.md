I am a research assistant at National Taiwan University, where my research focuses on robot kinematics, sensor fusion, and control. I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Cheng-Wei Chen](https://cwchenee.wixsite.com/nasa-ntuee) from the Department of Electrical Engineering at National Taiwan University, working on robot-assisted endodontic treatment. Additionally, I had the opportunity to be mentored by [Prof. Giovanni Beltrame](https://mistlab.ca/) from the Department of Computer Science at Polytechnique Montreal during a six-month research internship, where I integrated UWB systems with multi-drone and multi-vehicle networks.

# Research Project

## DentiBot: First robot designed for endodontic treatment
Keywords: Robot autonomy, sensor module design, hybrid control 
![DentiBot](images/dentibot.png)
In this project, we introduce the DentiBot, the first robot specifically designed for dental endodontic treatment. The DentiBot is equipped with a force and torque sensor, as well as a string-based Patient Tracking Module, allowing for real-time monitoring of endodontic file contact and patient movement. We propose a 6-DoF hybrid position/force controller that enables autonomous adjustment of the surgical path and compensation for patient movement, while also providing protection against endodontic file fracture. In addition, a file flexibility model is incorporated to compensate for file bending. Pre-clinical evaluations performed on acrylic root canal models and resin teeth confirm the feasibility of the DentiBot in assisting endodontic treatment.

One distinct feature of the DentiBot is 6-DoF string-based patient tracking module.
