I am a research assistance in National Taiwan University. My research interest is about robot kinematics, sensor fusion and control. I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Cheng-Wei Chen](https://cwchenee.wixsite.com/nasa-ntuee) from EE department, National Taiwan University. I was advised by [Prof. Giovanni Beltrame](https://mistlab.ca/) from CS department, Polytechnique Montreal for a 6 months research internship.  

You can find my CV here: [Hao-Fang's CV](https://github.com/HaoFangHowFun/howardcheng.github.io/blob/24aaea354ce38f4e01d8349d688d2b9e7c88f17e/assets/Hao_Fang_Cheng_CV_for_PHD_Application.pdf)
