I am a research assistant at National Taiwan University, where my research focuses on robot kinematics, sensor fusion, and control. I am fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://cwchenee.wixsite.com/nasa-ntuee"><i class="Prof. Cheng-Wei Chen"></i></a> from the Department of Electrical Engineering at National Taiwan University, working on robot-assisted endodontic treatment. Additionally, I had the opportunity to be mentored by [Prof. Giovanni Beltrame](https://mistlab.ca/) from the Department of Computer Science at Polytechnique Montreal during a six-month research internship, where I integrated UWB systems with multi-drone and multi-vehicle networks.

In this project, we introduce the DentiBot, the first robot specifically designed for dental endodontic treatment. The DentiBot is equipped with a force and torque sensor, as well as a string-based Patient Tracking Module, allowing for real-time monitoring of endodontic file contact and patient movement. We propose a 6-DoF hybrid position/force controller that enables autonomous adjustment of the surgical path and compensation for patient movement, while also providing protection against endodontic file fracture. In addition, a file flexibility model is incorporated to compensate for file bending. Pre-clinical evaluations performed on acrylic root canal models and resin teeth confirm the feasibility of the DentiBot in assisting endodontic treatment.\

## Electrical Impedance Sensing System Design for Abnormal Object Detection

<p align = "justify"> 
This project proposed a design for an electrical impedance (EI) sensing system. For the part of physical modeling, the harmonic electric fields of the EI sensing system are formulated by the distributed parameter element (DPE) method to calculate the electrode potentials for several injection patterns of different abnormal object distributions, and the computed electrode potentials are feed into a deep neural network (DNN) to estimate the location and size of the abnormal object. For the part of system development, an electric circuit that integrates the multiplexer and Howland pump is utilized to switch the current injection electrodes and control the injection currents. The harmonic electric fields computed by the DPE method are verified by the FEA software, and the effects of utilizing the DNN for abnormal object detection are numerically validated. The proposed design, along with a prototype of the EI sensing system, which is conducted on two kinds of materials, phantom and biological objects, have been experimentally compared.

In October 2019, I participated in the 2020 TDK National Creative Design Competition as part of a university team, where we achieved 2nd place in the Flying Group category. I led the first team from our university to compete in this event, where we designed and built an autonomous drone from scratch. The drone was capable of following a designated ground trajectory, navigating obstacles, and delivering payloads.
  
As the team leader, I was responsible for organizing the team, delegating tasks, and ensuring resource availability. My leadership and technical efforts were instrumental in guiding the team to a successful outcome, resulting in a fully functional and competitive drone design.
